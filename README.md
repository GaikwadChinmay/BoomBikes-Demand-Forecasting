# Linear-Regression-BikeRental

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end.  

This notebook focusses to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features

In this notebook, I have built a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes using the multiple features available in the dataset

This Linear Regression Model has achieved 82.6% accuracy on training dataset and around 87.6% accuracy on the test dataset. The performance analysis done considering various factors such as p-values from statistical model, R2 , VIF and RFE.
